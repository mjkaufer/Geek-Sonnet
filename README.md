Geek-Sonnet
===========
Your SDK’s to which I must compile;
To life without you could I not adjust;
You are the main method in my class file;
Together you turn me to me++;
 
I implement your interface each day;
But your love requires a try-catch case;
My affections will not fit in arrays;
OutOfMemoryError: No heap space;
 
My GPU overclocks at its max;
Because you make my clock frequencies speed;
With you I’ll make many a child class;
You fill all my super constructor’s needs;
 
SELECT * FROM People WHERE Love=’true’;
Should yield two data rows: Just me and you;
